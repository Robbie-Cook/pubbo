# [alpha] pubbo

> A fork of [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).

## Context

### Why?

Lerna is a great monorepo tool which was used almost ubiquitously.

However, recently, some critical problems have made it difficult to use. These include:

* Tagging builds and considering builds as published when they fail hooks: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/2018#issuecomment-753453525

* Dropping lerna updates altogether, even though it is widely loved: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/2716#issuecomment-744599179

* Lerna commands being documented patchily at best.

* Tagging builds *before* incrementing the versioning in the `package.json`s

This project aims to alleviate some of the pain.

## About

Splitting up large codebases into separate independently versioned packages
is extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many
repositories is _messy_ and difficult to track, and testing across repositories
becomes complicated very quickly.

To solve these (and many other) problems, some projects will organize their
codebases into multi-package repositories (sometimes called [monorepos](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)). Projects like [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules),
[Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages), and many others develop all of their packages within a
single repository.

**pubbo is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package
repositories with git and npm.**

pubbo can also reduce the time and space requirements for numerous
copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a
downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. See the
[hoist documentation](doc/hoist.md) for details.

### What does a pubbo repo look like?

There's actually very little to it. You have a file structure that looks like this:

```
my-pubbo-repo/
  package.json
  packages/
    package-1/
      package.json
    package-2/
      package.json
```

### What can pubbo do?

The two primary commands in pubbo are `pubbo bootstrap` and `pubbo publish`.

`bootstrap` will link dependencies in the repo together.
`publish` will help publish any updated packages.

## Getting Started

> The instructions below are for pubbo 3.x.
> We recommend using it instead of 2.x for a new pubbo project.

Let's start by installing pubbo as a dev dependency of your project with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```sh
$ mkdir pubbo-repo && cd $_
$ npx pubbo init
```

This will create a `lerna.json` configuration file as well as a `packages` folder, so your folder should now look like this:

```
pubbo-repo/
  packages/
  package.json
  lerna.json
```

## How It Works

pubbo allows you to manage your project using one of two modes: Fixed or Independent.

### Fixed/Locked mode (default)

Fixed mode pubbo projects operate on a single version line. The version is kept in the `lerna.json` file at the root of your project under the `version` key. When you run `pubbo publish`, if a module has been updated since the last time a release was made, it will be updated to the new version you're releasing. This means that you only publish a new version of a package when you need to.

> Note: If you have a major version zero, all updates are [considered breaking](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4). Because of that, running `pubbo publish` with a major version zero and choosing any non-prerelease version number will cause new versions to be published for all packages, even if not all packages have changed since the last release.

This is the mode that [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) is currently using. Use this if you want to automatically tie all package versions together. One issue with this approach is that a major change in any package will result in all packages having a new major version.

### Independent mode

`pubbo init --independent`

Independent mode pubbo projects allows maintainers to increment package versions independently of each other. Each time you publish, you will get a prompt for each package that has changed to specify if it's a patch, minor, major or custom change.

Independent mode allows you to more specifically update versions for each package and makes sense for a group of components. Combining this mode with something like [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) would make it less painful.

> Set the `version` key in `lerna.json` to `independent` to run in independent mode.

document where you might find the answer to your problem.

## Frequently asked questions

See [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).

## Concepts

pubbo will log to a `lerna-debug.log` file (same as `npm-debug.log`) when it encounters an error running a command.

pubbo also has support for [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope).

Run `pubbo --help` to see all available commands and options.

### lerna.json

```json
{
  "version": "1.1.3",
  "npmClient": "npm",
  "command": {
    "publish": {
      "ignoreChanges": ["ignored-file", "*.md"],
      "message": "chore(release): publish",
      "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
    },
    "bootstrap": {
      "ignore": "component-*",
      "npmClientArgs": ["--no-package-lock"]
    }
  },
  "packages": ["packages/*"]
}
```

- `version`: the current version of the repository.
- `npmClient`: an option to specify a specific client to run commands with (this can also be specified on a per command basis). Change to `"yarn"` to run all commands with yarn. Defaults to "npm".
- `command.publish.ignoreChanges`: an array of globs that won't be included in `pubbo changed/publish`. Use this to prevent publishing a new version unnecessarily for changes, such as fixing a `README.md` typo.
- `command.publish.message`: a custom commit message when performing version updates for publication.
- `command.publish.registry`: use it to set a custom registry url to publish to instead of
  npmjs.org, you must already be authenticated if required.
- `command.bootstrap.ignore`: an array of globs that won't be bootstrapped when running the `lerna bootstrap` command.
- `command.bootstrap.npmClientArgs`: array of strings that will be passed as arguments directly to `npm install` during the `lerna bootstrap` command.
- `command.bootstrap.scope`: an array of globs that restricts which packages will be bootstrapped when running the `lerna bootstrap` command.
- `packages`: Array of globs to use as package locations.

The packages config in `lerna.json` is a list of globs that match directories containing a `package.json`, which is how pubbo recognizes "leaf" packages (vs the "root" `package.json`, which is intended to manage the dev dependencies and scripts for the entire repo).

By default, pubbo initializes the packages list as `["packages/*"]`, but you can also use another directory such as `["modules/*"]`, or `["package1", "package2"]`. The globs defined are relative to the directory that `lerna.json` lives in, which is usually the repository root. The only restriction is that you can't directly nest package locations, but this is a restriction shared by "normal" npm packages as well.

For example, `["packages/*", "src/**"]` matches this tree:

```
packages/
├── foo-pkg
│   └── package.json
├── bar-pkg
│   └── package.json
├── baz-pkg
│   └── package.json
└── qux-pkg
    └── package.json
src/
├── admin
│   ├── my-app
│   │   └── package.json
│   ├── stuff
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── things
│       └── package.json
├── profile
│   └── more-things
│       └── package.json
├── property
│   ├── more-stuff
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── other-things
│       └── package.json
└── upload
    └── other-stuff
        └── package.json
```

Locating leaf packages under `packages/*` is considered a "best-practice", but is not a requirement for using pubbo.

### Common `devDependencies`

Most `devDependencies` can be pulled up to the root of a pubbo repo with `pubbo link convert`

The above command will automatically hoist things and use relative `file:` specifiers.

Hoisting has a few benefits:

- All packages use the same version of a given dependency
- Can keep dependencies at the root up-to-date with an automated tool such as [GreenKeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/)
- Dependency installation time is reduced
- Less storage is needed

Note that `devDependencies` providing "binary" executables that are used by
npm scripts still need to be installed directly in each package where they're
used.

For example the `nsp` dependency is necessary in this case for `pubbo run nsp`
(and `npm run nsp` within the package's directory) to work correctly:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "nsp": "nsp"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nsp": "^2.3.3"
  }
}
```

### Git Hosted Dependencies

pubbo allows target versions of local dependent packages to be written as a [git remote url](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) with a `committish` (e.g., `#v1.0.0` or `#semver:^1.0.0`) instead of the normal numeric version range.
This allows packages to be distributed via git repositories when packages must be private and a [private npm registry is not desired](https://www.dotconferences.com/2016/05/fabien-potencier-monolithic-repositories-vs-many-repositories).

Please note that pubbo does _not_ perform the actual splitting of git history into the separate read-only repositories. This is the responsibility of the user. (See [this comment](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1033#issuecomment-335894690) for implementation details)

```
// packages/pkg-1/package.json
{
  name: "pkg-1",
  version: "1.0.0",
  dependencies: {
    "pkg-2": "github:example-user/pkg-2#v1.0.0"
  }
}

// packages/pkg-2/package.json
{
  name: "pkg-2",
  version: "1.0.0"
}
```

In the example above,

- `pubbo bootstrap` will properly symlink `pkg-2` into `pkg-1`.
- `pubbo publish` will update the committish (`#v1.0.0`) in `pkg-1` when `pkg-2` changes.
